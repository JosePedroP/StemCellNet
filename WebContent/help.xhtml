	<h1 class="title">What is StemCellNet ?</h1>
	<br/>
	
	
	<p class="text"><strong>StemCellNet</strong> is an interactive platform for retrieval and analysis of molecular 
	networks associated with stem cells and their marker genes. It contains a large number of physical 
	and regulatory interactions both from human and mouse, which can be queried by the user through the 
	input of a set of gene or protein identifiers. The web-interface includes various filtering options 
	for prioritization, and allows the upload of own data for display of differential expression. As a 
	unique feature of <strong>StemCellNet</strong>, the obtained networks can be rapidly screened for genes 
	included in various published stemness signatures. This feature can also be applied to dissect 
	pathogenetic processes, in which stem cell related mechanisms play key roles, such as in 
	degenerative diseases and oncogenesis.</p>
	
	
	<br/>
	<h1 class="subtitle">Which data is included in StemCellNet? </h1>
	<br/>
	
	
	<p class="text">StemCellNet integrates physical and regulatory interactions from various sources. 
	A complete list of all the interaction data currently included in StemCellNet can be seen <a href="statistics.jsf">here</a>.</p>
	
	
	<br/>
	<h1 class="title">Tutorial for StemCellNet</h1>
	<br/>
	
	
	<p class="text">In the following, we describe the main features of <strong>StemCellNet</strong> using as input set <i>CITED1</i>, 
	a transcriptional co-activator, and the growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible proteins <i>GADD45A</i> and <i>GADD45G</i>.
	The set can be obtained as input by pressing the <strong>Example</strong> button.</p>
	
	<br/>
	<h1 class="title" id="sec2">Selecting central nodes</h1>
	<br/>
	<p class="text">The first step in using StemCellNet is simply to input of  a list of gene identifiers 
	(including include gene name, gene symbol, Entrez Gene ID, Uniprot ID and Ensembl ID for human or mouse) 
	in the search box and pressing the <strong>Search</strong> button. The inputted  identifiers are then matched 
	against the list of genes/proteins included in StemCellNet. For the matches, the genes symbol, their 
	description, aliases and various identifiers linked to other databases are given. Furthermore, a set of 
	buttons is displayed indicating the original source of interactions for the found genes (Figure 1).</p>

	<p align="center"><strong>Figure 1. List of genes found in StemCellNet.</strong></p>
	<br/>
	<p class="text">Once a list of genes is obtained, the next step is to select which ones will serve as 
	central nodes. The network will be constructed around these central nodes based on the interactions 
	included in StemCellNet for them. After selecting the central nodes, press <strong>Draw Network</strong>.</p>
	
	<br/>
	<h1 class="title" id="sec3">Analyzing the network</h1>
	<br/>
	<p class="text">As shown in Figure 2, the page, which renders the 
	retrieved interaction network and serves as interface for 
	network-orientated analyses in StemCellNet, is divided into two 
	panels: the left one for the graphical display of the network and 
	the right one listing the available tools. The later one  is further 
	subdivided based in functionality, which will be described below.</p>
	
	<p align="center"><img src="./images/F2.png" width="70%" height="70%"/></p>
	<p align="center"><strong>Figure 2. StemCellNet network window.</strong> 1- Network display;

	3- Stemness gene set selection boxes; 4- Stemness  enrichment calculation; 5- Expression data analysis; 
	6- Network filters; 7- Network export.</p>
	
	<br/>
	<p class="text">In the default display, the central nodes are larger and marked in grey whereas 
	the interacting proteins as shown as yellow nodes. Protein-protein  interactions are represented 
	as blue edges, while transcriptional regulatory interactions by red ones.</p>
	<br/>
	
	<h1 class="subtitle">Stemness gene sets</h1>
	<br/>
	<p class="text">StemCellNet includes currently 20 gene sets, which have 
	previously been linked to stemness (i.e. to the characteristic feature of stem 
	cells: the capacity to both self-renew and differentiate into mature cells). 
	These gene (also referred to as stemness signatures) sets have been derived from three different types of sources: 
	(i) ChIP-chip experiments detecting activated target genes of the core 
	transcription factors Nanog, Pou5f1 (Oct4), and Sox2, or 
	co-activated by all three transcription factors (abbreviated here as NOS targets), (ii) 
	gene expression studies to identify up-regulated genes  in stem cells 
	compared to other types of (differentiated) cells and (iii) large-scale functional RNAi screens to 
	detect genes whose knock-down leads to loss of stem cell markers. A table with an 
	overview of the included stemness gene sets with references to the published 
	studies can be seen <h:outputLink value="statistics.jsf#stemnessgenesets">here</h:outputLink>.
	</p>
	<br/>
	<p class="text">To map stemness gene sets onto a network, you can select the relevant gene set by activating 
	the check box and press the <strong>Map gene sets</strong> button. The size of the nodes is then adjusted 
	to be proportional to the number of stemness gene sets, in which the corresponding gene appears. 
	Nodes which represent genes that do not appear in any stemness gene set are displayed as rectangles.</p>
	<br/>
	<p class="text">As an alternative to visualization these results can also be downloaded in the format CSV using 
	the <strong>Download set table</strong> button. Here, a table is outputted with the genes and their occurrence in stemness signatures. 
	It should be noted that the file will only contain data about nodes which are present in at least one set.</p>
	<br/>
	
	<p align="center"><img src="./images/F3.png" width="40%" height="40%"/></p>
	<p align="center"><strong>Figure 3. Network after mapping the gene sets.</strong> Nodes corresponding to 
	genes, such as the key transcription factors POU5F1, NANOG or SOX2, which appear in many stemness gene 
	sets, are noticeably increased in size</p>
	<br/>
	
	
	
	<!--  
	
	<p class="text">The <strong>Identify candidates</strong> button serves to highlight nodes which are 
	not present in any set but are connected with nodes which are. This functionality serves to 
	<strong>[Matthias could you write something about it ?]</strong>. Nodes highlighted are 
	converted into octagons and their colour changes to blue. The size of the highlighted nodes is 
	proportional to the number of sets their neighbours belong to.</p>-->
	
	<p class="text">In some cases, it might be interest to identify novel candidates genes associated with 
	stemness. To assist researchers in this gene prioritization problem StemCellNet has a tool that 
	evaluates the connectivity within the network and scores potential candidates accordingly. 
	Currently, four variations of the ‘direct neighbour counting’ approach are available: 
	unweighted, weighted scoring, weighted by co-expression scoring and weighted by co-expression and 
	set number scoring. These methods are motivated on the ‘guilt by association’ 
	principle and assume in our context that the more stemness genes that a candidate gene 
	is directly connected to, the more likely it is that the candidate itself is associated with stemness.</p>
	<br/>
	<p class="text">The <strong>Unweighted connectivity</strong> button calls the unweighted scoring version 
	of this function in which the score of a candidate is simply the sum of direct interactions with 
	stemness associated genes. Alternatively by using the <strong>Weighted connectivity</strong>  button each 
	interaction is weighted by the number how many time the interacting genes occurs in a 
	stemness signature. Note that for using either option a group of stemness sets must be 
	mapped first into the network (by pressing the <strong>Map gene sets</strong> sets button).</p>
	<br/>
	<p class="text">
	
	
	Two related methods which utilize co-expression between interacting genes are the 
	(i) <strong>Weighted by co-expression</strong> and (ii) <strong>Weighted by co-expression 
	and set count</strong>, which can be executed by respective buttons. Both methods are 
	variants of the unweighted connectivity and weighted connectivity scoring respectively, 
	as the each interaction is additionally weighted by the correlation coefficient for 
	co-expression. Basically, the scores are calculated as the sum of (weighted) interactions. 
	Additionally, each factor representing an interaction between two genes is multiplied by 
	the correlation coefficient for these two genes. The data set, from which the correlation 
	coefficients are derived, can be selected by the user in a drop-down menu. 
	Note that only interactions with positive correlation of expression contribute to 
	the final score:  When the correlation coefficient is positive the adjustment is 
	calculated by multiplying the correlation coefficient by 10 and normalizing the results, 
	so that the decimal is removed. In contrast, when the correlation coefficient is zero 
	or negative, the terms representing these interactions are multiplied by 0.</p>
	
	<br/>
	<h1 class="subtitle">Significance of enrichment</h1>
	<br/>
	
	<p class="text">Enrichment of genes from the stemness sets in the network can be calculated by pressing the 
	<strong>Calculate enrichment</strong> button. It is not necessary to map the stemness sets onto the 
	network before calculating the enrichment. The calculation is based on the Fisher’s exact test. 
	For each stemness gene set, a p-value is displayed for the significance together with the number of 
	genes found within the network.</p>
	
	<p class="text">It is important to note that the calculation does not take into account nodes, 
	which were filtered out of the network (using the functionality described below). Also, the 
	values are not automatically updated, when a filter is applied. In that situation the 
	function has to be manually recalled.</p>
	
	<br/>
	<h1 class="subtitle">Gene expression</h1>
	<br/>
	
	<p class="text">Gene expression data can be uploaded into StemCellNet as tab delimited table 
	with the following format:</p>
	<p class="text">1st column: Entrez Gene ID or Gene Symbol.</p>
	<p class="text">2nd column: Expression values (such as signal intensities or  fold changes).</p>
	<p class="text">3rd column: P-value.</p>
	<p class="text">4rt column: Sample description.</p>
	<br/>
	<p class="text">Once the file is uploaded, the nodes can be colored based on a user-defined 
	cutoff values for either the expression values or the p-value. In the case of expression value, 
	nodes associated  with a smaller value are colored green, while nodes with a larger 
	value are colored red. Nodes with no associated values keep their original coloring. For filtering based on 
	p-values, only nodes with an p-value smaller than the chosen
	cutoff are highlighted. Here, nodes passing the threshold are colored red if they have positive expression,
	whereas they appear green for negative expression. This filtering option can be used in the common cases 
	where the expression values in the file provide differential expression given as logged fold changes.   
	In either situation yellow nodes can optionally be filtered 
	out of the network.</p>
	<br/>
	<p class="text">It should be noted that files can contain data from several different samples assuming that 
	each has a unique sample id. This enables the simultaneous uploading of expression data for multiple samples 
	and thus facilitates the analysis of more complex experiments such as time series.</p>
	<br/>
	<p class="text">A exemplary file compatible with the StemCellNet format can be downloaded <a href="example.txt">here</a>. This file provides an excerpt 
	from a time series experiment, in which mouse embryonic stem cells have undergone differentiation through the hanging droplet method. Note that three time points
	are included: day 0, day 3 and day 10. Once the file is uploaded, the time point of interest can be used for filtering by choosing it in the drop down menu.</p>
	<br/>

	<p align="center"><strong>Figure 4. Network with mapped expression data using p-values for day 0 with a cutoff of 0.01.</strong> 
	A- with no filtering; B- with filtering.</p>
	<br/>
	<p class="text">Alternatively expression data that we have already included in StemCellNet, can be used for 
	analysis. In particular, data from several time series are currently available to choose from. 
	These data can be mapped onto the network, or used for filtering. The table below gives an 
	overview of the currently included data sets and their origin. For all datasets, expression values 
	have been log2 transformed and adjusted, so that mean expression of a gene in a time series is equal to 
	zero. An exception is given by the proteomics data set, which is normalized to the expression at 
	the start of the reprogramming process (i.e. day 0). It should be noted that the expression values 
	contained in the database have no p-values associated.</p>

	<h1 class="subtitle">Filters</h1>
	<br/>
	<p class="text">StemCellNet creates networks with both human and mouse interactions. 
	However if only interactions specific for one of the species are of interest, it is 
	possible to remove interaction from the other organism though either the 
	<strong>Remove non human</strong> or <strong>Remove non mouse</strong> buttons.</p>
	<br/>
	<p class="text">This option removes foremost edges. In case that a node is connected 
	only with edges which have been removed, it will also be removed.</p>
	<br/>
	<p class="text">Additionally, StemCellNet provides filtering options for removing 
	either physical or regulatory interactions.</p>
	<br/>
	<p class="text">Also it is possible to filter the interactions based in the number 
	of associated Pubmed ids. In this case a threshold must be set before using the filter. 
	The filtering removes all interactions which have been associated with less 
	publications than the chosen threshold. This functionality can help to derive 
	high-confidence networks.</p>
	<br/>
	<p class="text">Co-expression filters are based in the expression data stored in the 
	associated database (Table 2). This filters can be used to either remove all the 
	interactions which have a correlation coefficient value less than a chosen threshold 
	or to map the values into the network, in the last case the width of the edges will 
	become proportional to the associated correlation coefficient. Regardless of the 
	option selected this types of filters always remove the edges with no associated 
	correlation coefficient.</p>
	<br/>
	<p class="text">Finally this toolbar also contains a functionality which can alter 
	the size of the edges based in the number of associated Pubmed ids. While not a filter 
	this operation can be used to give an idea of the confidence of the network. </p>
